	\begin{itemize}
		\item We will stream, record and publish nearly all talks with your help
		\item You can operate the cameras and video mixer
		\item At do-not-record talks we also need angels % for guarding the camera or to do a recording, but no live stream
		\item We (people from c3voc) will be there to help
		\item The live stream video signal will also be the final recording
		\item We aim for consistent quality, but everybody make mistakes -- don't blame yourself!
